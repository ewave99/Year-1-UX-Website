        <p>Many students arrive at university without prior knowledge or experience of cooking.<br>
            Furthermore, the importance of budgeting brings worries of how a varied, interesting
            diet can be achieved. </p>
        <p> At Food for Thought, we're here to help. </p>
        <p>
            We're not obsessed with salads or special dieting plans. We simply know that
            a varied diet improves your health, and improving your health makes you feel good,
            and feeling good is extremely important. Especially if you have a busy student
            schedule. So join us!
