## Adding a recipe to the website...

### If you know how to use git:

1. Clone repository
2. Duplicate `boilerplate.html` and re-name the copy to the name of your recipe. 
3. Write HTML code for your recipe under where it says 'Your content here' in the file.
4. Add your image for the recipe to the `assets/img` folder.
5. Commit and push to the repo.

Optional: Add a card element for the recipe in the Featured Recipes section of the homepage.

### If you can't use git:

1. download `boilerplate.html`
2. re-name it to the name of your recipe
3. Write your recipe HTML where it says 'Your content here'
4. email the HTML file to me (emurd001 at gold.ac.uk) along with your recipe image and I will add it to the repo.
